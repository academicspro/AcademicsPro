# Getting Started



---

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. **Docker Compose Plugin**: Ensure the Docker Compose plugin is installed. Verify with:
   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```
3. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (v18 or later).

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajneeshrana0/AcademicsPro.git
   cd AcademicsPro
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:admin@postgres:5432/app_db
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
   ```

3. Install dependencies (optional for local setup without Docker):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the Application

### 1. **Development Mode**
Run the following command for hot-reloading:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- App will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
- PostgreSQL will be available at `localhost:5432`.

### 2. **Production Mode**
For a production-ready setup, update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use the production stage and run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```
- App will run optimized for production.

---

## Prisma Setup

### Generate Prisma Client
Run the following command to generate Prisma client:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> npx prisma generate
```

### Migrations
Run Prisma migrations:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> npx prisma migrate dev
```

---



## Docker Commands

### Build and Start Containers
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Stop Containers
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Remove Containers, Networks, and Volumes
```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

### Access the App Container
```bash
docker exec -it nextjs_app sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Docker Compose Command Not Found**:
   Use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.

2. **Hot Reload Not Working**:
   Ensure volumes are correctly mapped in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - .:/app
     - /app/node_modules
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   Verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
